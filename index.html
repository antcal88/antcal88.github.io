 			<h2> Unit 2 </h2>
 			<p> In this unit, I relearned the basics of HTML, which I wasn't too familiar with before. I have a better understanding of the materials now.</p>

 			<p> One of the difficult parts of this unit was getting used to coding once again and getting used to how HTML operates. Some other difficulties were:</p>

 			<ul> The intolerance of HTML</ul>
 			<ul>Only knowing a small amount of commands</ul>
 			<ul> Finding and correcting mistakes</ul>



 			<h2> Unit 3 </h2>
 			<p> Unit 3 taught a lot of vital information, info you need to know to truly make your websites look great. With CSS having such a large impact on the appeal of your site, I'm glad we had a lot of time to learn the basics.</p>

 			<p> Unit 2 prepared me for more coding in Unit 3, so most of the difficulty came from not knowing code or missing small parts. Overall, three of the harder parts of this unit were:</p>

 			<ul> Mixing around small symbols (such as semicolons and dashes) </ul>
 			<ul> Only knowing a select few commands </ul>
 			<ul> Some CSS just downright not working sometimes </ul>

 			<h2> Unit 4 </h2>

 			<p> Unit 4 was a lot of fun because it's where we really began to make things looks pretty. I already love anything graphics myself, so being able to impliment that into my work here was a lot of fun for me. </p>
 			<p> Since I have a lot of past experience, the unit was quite easy for me. </p>

         alt="Camera" />
         	</a>
        

 

  			<h2> Unit 5 </h2>
 			<p> Unit 5 was special to me because it introduced me to another side of Web Design that I've never used before. The coding itself is pretty straightforward, but is also very interesting because it's unique from CSS and HTML. Still, some harder parts of this unit were:</p>

      <ul> Unforgiving with spelling/capitalization </ul>
      <ul> "Interesting" code, might need to look up reference code often </ul>
      <ul> Easily frustrating with the smallest mistake ruining the entire script </ul>

  			<h2> Unit 6 </h2>
 			<p> Unit 6 was interesting in the fact that it was the first time we showed our work to other people, mostly from other program areas. It's really an exciting feeling now that I realize we're getting closer and closer to a final professional site. In this mission, we learned:</p>

      <ul> How to validate all of our code manually</ul>

      <ul> How to use online HTML correctors </ul>

      <ul> How to gather info from a usability test </ul>

 			<h2> Unit 7 </h2>
